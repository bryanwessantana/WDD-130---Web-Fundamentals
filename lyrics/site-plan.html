      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Our company created this website so our clients and students can get a better access to
        their agenda, contents, contacts, activities (audios, texts, images) and support from the 
        teachers to help them.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>We are always looking for clients that need help to learn a new language. 
        We have technical English, for travel, work, study, exams (preparing them 
        for TOEFL and IELTS). And as different English School, we also work with 
        language consulting, doing translations (academic, literary, websites, etc).</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        People can find answers on our website when looking for courses and materials we have, so 
        they can use and receive the education and help they need. They can find video tutorials, 
        books, activities, audio, films, and history books to improve their English. If they have 
        some doubts that are not on our website, they can contact us to schedule a meeting and talk 
        to one of our employees and teachers. If they already were clients and students, they can 
        find out when the meetings will happen, how their assignments and grades are going, and if 
        there is something they need to send or correct in their activities with our feedback and 
        rubric system.

      <h3>English Standard & Educational Games</h3>
      <p>
        They can see how their English is with our English Standard Test, and then if they want 
        something more specific, they can save their login on our site to talk to us and schedule a 
        meeting. Also, they can do some easy activities like listening or reading something and 
        complete activities to receive points and learn more. They can use these points to receive 
        gifts from the school. Also, if they accumulate specific punctuation on the website, they 
        can apply it at a discount on their monthly payment.

      <h3>Applying English at Different Areas</h3>
      <p>
        They will come to our website because we will respond and contact them always with priority 
        and care to fulfill their requests. We can make them grow their English with efficiency and 
        quality so they will always prioritize us to care about them and teach them in the best way 
        possible. We already have clients and students that have been with us for a few years, and 
        they all were happy and reached their goals of traveling to many countries and applying 
        their new abilities and skills in their jobs and universities. Many of them have done the 
        TOEFL and IELTS and have passed.
