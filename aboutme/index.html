    <h2>Bryan Santana</h2>
    <p>Hi guys, Bryan here. I'm from Brazil, currently living in Paran√°. I'm single and living with family.
    <p>I finished Pathway last semester, and I wanted to serve a mission after completing it. But it will only be possible next year when I will receive my military discharge. So I decided to start my studies at BYU while I didn't have the discharge, and I always wanted to work with technology, so I think the next years will be the best after my mission.</p>
    <p>I'm geek, so I love Harry Potter, Star Wars, etc. I like to play guitar and other instruments, compose, read books and hangout with my friends. I play basketball, football and practice karate.</p>
